I am a PhD candidate at College of William & Mary. I am working under [Dr. Denys Poshyvanyk](https://www.cs.wm.edu/~denys/). My research focuses on applying Deep Learning to Software Engineering tasks. At the moment, I am working on trustworthy, and interpretable Large Language Models for Software Engineering.
